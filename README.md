# Credit-risk-classification
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

To complete this project I will :
* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

# Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
1)Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

2)Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

3)Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

# Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

1) Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
2) Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
3) Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
3.1)Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
3.2)Generate a confusion matrix.
3.3)Print the classification report.

4) Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels? The Oversampled data improves on the initial Logical Regression model. Balanced Accuracy score increases from 0.954 to 0.996. It helps to better predict the true positives meaning that it is more effective at distinguishing high-risk loans with high recall accuraccy.

# Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

1) Use the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data. Be sure to confirm that the labels have an equal number of data points.
2) Use the LogisticRegression classifier and the resampled data to fit the model and make predictions.
3)  the model’s performance by doing the following:
3.1)Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
3.2)Generate a confusion matrix.
3.3)Print the classification report.

Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
The Oversampled data improves on the initial Logical Regression model increasing the balanced Accuracy score from 95% to 99%. It helps to better predict the true positives meaning that it is more effective at distinguishing high-risk loans with high recall accuraccy.
A lending company might want a model that requires a higher recall because:
Healthy loans being identified as a non-healthy loan might be more costly for a lending company since it might cause the loss of customers.
Non-healthy loans being identified as a healthy loan might surely be more costly for a lending company due to the loss of funds being provided by the lender.
